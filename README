URL Prober

I'm running few exit nodes on TOR, and I decide to look to the 
<s>things no one should look</s> pages are visited via TOR.
I created simple tshark script to catch URI requests on outgoing 
interface and this script is designed to give some simple analyzis 
of results.

It takes list of urls from stdin (one per line) and generate
report. All links to .js, .css, .ico and other useless files
are ignored, rest is processed.
